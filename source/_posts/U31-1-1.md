### Dialogue 3

:And now for this week trans talk. Last week we talk about job trends in three populary fields tecnology, food in restaurant, and medical work. Today we'll' look at a new trends, the changing roal of a employment agency and helping people follow their hearts 
With us today id XXX , owner of the dream job employment agency, welcome Payjor, tell us little about you agency, what's different about it?
:Well, as the name of dream job suggest, our goal is to try to find people jobs that are perfect for them, this means job that can make them happy, because they are using their tlents and skills to do something they love. In other we don't find people just any other job that give them a paycheck
:What do you mean?
:There is a famous saying that I found in the internet somewhere,I don't remember who said it, but it impressed me a lot. Choose the job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life, they put another way, if you have a jpb that you love work isn't work, it's something you enjoy, you know I mean, it's something you look for to when you weak up in the morning , and something that you put small on your face when you thing about at the end of the a long day.
:So what' your secret, I mean how do you help people find a perfect job?
:I make a happy to really get my clients. That means learning about their likes and dislikes and what they do in their free time. All ot this help us to put a right person with a right job
:And can you say the ... of dream jobs is your dream job?
:For sure. that took me well to figure out. When I was in high school and college, I thought I would to be an actor. I was in the theater club, and I acted a lot of plays. I was always the no1 actor. But after college, I couldn't find any acting jobs, and job I did find texi driver, waitter, shop assistant mainly feel horrible. A lot of my coluges and friends in the same boat. In other words, many of those friends won't well happly in their work. I knew an unhappy teachers, miserable business people, you name it, we met ever week and we talked about our problems. And after while, I figure it out.
:Can you explain men? what did you figure out?
:Sorry, I mean I finally figure  out that my dream job, with happing people find their dream jobs. That's the thing that really makes me happy. And how I get this idea to start dream jobs. And guess what? I work really hard. but I love going to the work in the morning and have a small on my face when I come home at night
:Interesting. And so you get correct job, Joe. Dreams job is .... in the agency today. But looking at who people are jobs that can make them happy. After the break, we talk more ablut other agencies like dream jobs
